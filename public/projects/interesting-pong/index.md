# Project Summary
Interesting Pong is a spin-off of the traditional game of pong, where the images of my friends' faces replace the boring old white
ball, and their voices scream at you when you score a point.

There's a certain kind of satisfaction that can only be found from hitting your friends' faces around a virtual screen - this
satisfaction was what drove me to make this simple game. Written in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (using the Canvas API), I designed a simple
game of pong with my friends' faces embedded on my monitor, and the worst paddle collision implemented in the history of pong.

Needless to say, this was a really fun side project that I enjoyed making, and I hope this weird abomination of a pong game lives on.
