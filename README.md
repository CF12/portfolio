# CF12's Portfolio
This is a portfolio I made to track my projects and show information about myself.
It can be accessed from GitPages: https://cf12.github.io/portfolio/

## Project Layout
The main code is located in src/. Please note that this code is **not viewable like** any other html file. It needs to be compiled with React and Webpack before it can be viewed / served.

In branch gh-pages, I compiled the website to be viewable on Git Pages. The layout and code looks funky in there because it was compiled using Webpack, which purposely compacts the code for better performance.

## Dependencies
I used a wide assortment of open source dependencies, which includes many of the following:
- Create React App [ https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app ]
- React [ https://github.com/facebook/react ]
- Webpack [ https://github.com/webpack/webpack ]
- jQuery [ https://github.com/jquery/jquery ]
- particles.js [ https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/ ]
- React Gif Player [ https://github.com/benwiley4000/react-gif-player ]
