# CF12's Portfolio
This, right here, this thing right here, this GitHub repo, yeah this repo thing, this is my portfolio.
Made with only the FINEST culinary arts and EXPERT craftsmanship (A.K.A. ReactJS + Webpack 4), I present to you a dish of pure
DELICACY and FLAVOR (A.K.A. a compiled, minified, < 15MB single page app). How delicious.

(I honestly don't know why I wrote all of that. Must be brain damage.)

Welcome to my personal portfolio repo. This project aims to provide
people with some information about the kind of person I am, what I do, and what kinds of things I've done before.

The site is currently live, on Google FireBase, and you can view it here: https://cf12.me

## Project Layout
All of the source code is located under the **src/** directory. Please note that because this is a ReactJS app,
the code must be compiled using `npm run build`, or `yarn build`, before it can be served under the **build/** dir.

## Dependencies
I used a wide assortment of open source dependencies, which includes the following:
- Webpack [ https://github.com/webpack/webpack ]
