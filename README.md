# CF12's Portfolio
This is a portfolio I made to track my projects and show information about myself.
It can be accessed from this repo's GitPages link: https://cf12.github.io/portfolio/

## Project Layout
The main code is located in **src/** under branch **master**. All the assets and fonts are in there, as well as the JSX files including the HTML and JavaScript code. I coded my CSS in their own seperate files, but they're still imported and utilized within the .jsx files. Please note that the code needs to be compiled in order to actually be viewable.

In the branch **gh-pages**, I've compiled the website to be viewable, and it is hosted using GitPages. The layout and code looks funky in there because it was compiled using Webpack, which purposely compacts the code for better performance.

## Dependencies
For my portfolio, I used a wide assortment of open source dependencies which includes the following:
- React [ https://github.com/facebook/react ]
- Webpack [ https://github.com/webpack/webpack ]

## Coding Standards
This project uses the Standard JS Coding Style. Most of my Javascript projects are coded with the Standard JS Coding Style.
